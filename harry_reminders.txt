Less tension in left hand just tap feet and worry about timing <a href='D:\MusicProduction\127v2'>D:\MusicProduction\127v2 test link</a>

For stamina, play at 160-180 for a long time, softly, Play serpent at 160 4x in a row <a href='D:\MusicProduction\127v2'>D:\MusicProduction\127v2 test link</a>
Jens -Does kick duck sidechain using most stable kick, usually a sample. Compressor type doesn't really matter. Has like 2-4 dbs of reduction. Attack is slower than you would think, 500 ms. Fast release <a href='D:\MusicProduction\127v2'>D:\MusicProduction\127v2 test link</a>
Use different Irs on L and R to avoid fatigue (jens) <a href='D:\MusicProduction\127v2'>D:\MusicProduction\127v2 test link</a>
Mb2 has good guitar tone. But the audio gridder version has ampknob which is considerably better, need to use this as a template. And remember to make left and right IRs different. 
Intonation: tune the string using the 12th fret harmonic. Then finger the twelfth fret. If it is sharp then you need to increase the distance (move the bridge further away, turn screw clockwise).  If it is flat then you need to decrease the distance (move the bridge closer)
On riffs that are heavy but also intricate, leave the palm mutes at normal level but automate the clean/intricate parts so that their volume is lower going into the reamp!
When tracking guitars: record through right speaker, where guitarist is sitting. And if you already have a track recorded, play it through the left speaker. Guitarist should be near right speaker.  Make sure you think about the volume balance between the two.
Jens: When you amp the bass, the amp cuts out both the highs and the subs. So adding a DI track can be used to increase the SUBS. You do NOT need to do this every time.
Otero: Try on master boosting a cool freq in pro q 3 then split into L/R and change the frequencies by maybe .5k or something small...will add width. He tried it on the spot and really liked it. 
On C4/C6 OR proq3 - use sneap compression ONLY on palm mutes. So find a PM spot and do the eq there - it really shouldn't be working on other spots so much. 170-220 usually. Use invert gain for this.
Keep pick attack in when editing! Set nudge at 1/128 or 1/64 and use that instead of dragging left after cut.  See what nudge shortcut is.  Pick attack and transient should happen before gridline.
Vocal tuning: Don't tune the transient of syllables - Yes less tuning on the start of the note often
Output 1-4 on scarlett is lower output for monitors. Use 5-8 for reamping.
Jens Vocals: Use deesser before delay!!... If you only have 1 vocal track then make a copy and downpitch the 2nd one.  
Jens: During slow parts put more distortion on the ambient snare sample and turn it up
MIDI recording in Cubase: mute other takes when recording to avoid dropouts
Phil Pluskota - Tg2 chandler pre for guitars... Try ts with weird settings to calm low end, small drive but tone all the way up etc, change level...Dark part of cone but use HP to get highs back
Phil Pluskota - try these: Boost 4-6 k, 2-3 db, but then do a 7k LP...On recto, lots of fizz, ok to boost certain frequencies to pick the right one â€“ think NM... Try transient desgnr, blast transient and sustain (maybe negative sustain?)
Jens: Apparently the C1 compressor is clean like the Pro C from fab filter - so ok to use the C1
for monitor issues try uninstalling the driver from device manager for the monitor, then run "msdt.exe -id DeviceDiagnostic"
Otero: when trying out different drum compression, especially snare, do a fairly slow attack and smash it to hell and see how it reacts. This will show you the character of the compressor.
